__A RethinkDB adapter for the [Waterline ORM](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline). Works in a [Sails.js](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) app or anything using Waterline for the ORM.__

__Version:__ 0.5.0

This is pre-1.0.0 alpha software! Many RethinkDB/Waterline features/operations are not supported yet.

Supported operations:

- registerCollection
- teardown
- define
- drop
- describe
- find
- create
- createEach
- update

Waterline criteria options (lessThan, greaterThan, etc.) don't work yet.
